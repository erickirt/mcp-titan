# Smart Memory Pruning Implementation

This document describes the implementation of Step 6: Smart Pruning with Information-Gain in the Titan Memory Architecture.

## Overview

The smart pruning system implements an information-gain based approach to intelligently reduce memory usage while maintaining high-quality memories. The system uses a composite scoring function that combines entropy, surprise, and redundancy measurements to determine which memories to keep.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **MemoryPruner Class** (`src/pruning.ts`)
   - Main pruning engine with configurable parameters
   - Implements information-gain scoring algorithm
   - Handles memory distillation and validation

2. **MCP Integration** (`src/index.ts`)
   - `prune_memory` tool endpoint for manual pruning
   - Automatic pruning based on capacity thresholds
   - Statistics reporting and monitoring

3. **Model Integration** (`src/model.ts`)
   - `pruneMemoryByInformationGain()` method
   - Automatic pruning checks during memory operations
   - Configuration and statistics access

## Scoring Algorithm

The pruning system uses a composite score for each memory:

```
Score = (entropy × entropy_weight) + (surprise × surprise_weight) - (redundancy × redundancy_weight)
```

### Components

#### 1. Entropy Calculation
- Converts memory vectors to probability distributions using softmax
- Calculates Shannon entropy: `-∑(p * log(p))`
- Higher entropy indicates more information content

#### 2. Surprise Measurement
- Uses stored surprise history from memory updates
- Represents how unexpected the memory was when first stored
- Higher surprise indicates more valuable memories

#### 3. Redundancy Detection
- Computes pairwise cosine similarity between all memories
- Takes maximum similarity with other memories as redundancy score
- Higher redundancy indicates less unique information

## Configuration

The system supports extensive configuration through the `PruningConfig` interface:

```typescript
interface PruningConfig {
  keepPercentage: number;        // 0.7 = keep 70% of memories
  minMemoriesToKeep: number;     // Never prune below this threshold
  maxCapacity: number;           // Trigger automatic pruning at this size
  entropyWeight: number;         // Weight for entropy in scoring (1.0)
  surpriseWeight: number;        // Weight for surprise in scoring (1.2)
  redundancyWeight: number;      // Weight for redundancy penalty (0.8)
  redundancyThreshold: number;   // Similarity threshold for redundancy (0.85)
  enableDistillation: boolean;   // Whether to distill pruned memories (true)
}
```

## Memory Distillation

When enabled, pruned memories are not simply discarded but are distilled into long-term memory:

1. **Weighted Averaging**: Pruned memories are combined using access counts as weights
2. **Long-term Integration**: Distilled vectors are added to long-term memory
3. **Capacity Management**: Long-term memory is truncated if it exceeds 30% of total capacity

## Triggers

Pruning can be triggered in multiple ways:

### 1. Automatic Capacity-Based
- Triggers when memory usage exceeds `maxCapacity`
- Checked during memory store operations
- Maintains system performance and memory limits

### 2. Manual MCP Command
- `prune_memory` tool with optional threshold parameter
- Allows fine-grained control over pruning intensity
- Returns detailed statistics about the pruning operation

### 3. Programmatic API
- `pruneMemoryByInformationGain(threshold?)` method
- Direct integration with other system components
- Supports custom thresholds and configurations

## Validation and Quality Assurance

The system includes comprehensive validation:

### State Validation
- Checks tensor shape consistency after pruning
- Validates that all tensors have matching dimensions
- Detects NaN and infinite values in memory state

### Quality Analysis
- Compares entropy and surprise metrics before/after pruning
- Calculates improvement ratios for quality assessment
- Provides feedback on pruning effectiveness

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity
- Information scoring: O(n²) for redundancy calculation
- Sorting and selection: O(n log n)
- Memory creation: O(n × d) where d is embedding dimension

### Memory Usage
- Temporary tensors for calculations are managed with `tf.tidy()`
- Pruned memories are properly disposed to prevent memory leaks
- Configurable long-term memory limits prevent unbounded growth

## Statistics and Monitoring

The system provides comprehensive statistics:

```typescript
interface PruningStats {
  totalPrunings: number;           // Total number of pruning operations
  averageReduction: number;        // Average reduction ratio
  lastPruningTime: number;         // Timestamp of last pruning
  timeSinceLastPruning: number;    // Time since last pruning
  shouldPrune: boolean;            // Whether pruning is recommended
  currentMemorySize: number;       // Current active memory count
  maxCapacity: number;             // Maximum capacity threshold
}
```

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive unit tests covering:

- Basic pruning operations and logic
- Information gain calculations (entropy, surprise, redundancy)
- State validation and error handling
- Configuration management and statistics
- Edge cases (empty states, single memories, extreme configurations)
- Performance testing with large memory states

### Test Coverage
- 26 test cases covering all major functionality
- Tests for both normal operation and edge cases
- Performance benchmarks for large-scale pruning
- Memory quality improvement validation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Pruning
```typescript
const pruner = new MemoryPruner({
  keepPercentage: 0.8,
  enableDistillation: true
});

const result = await pruner.pruneMemory(memoryState);
console.log(`Reduced from ${result.originalCount} to ${result.finalCount} memories`);
```

### MCP Command
```bash
# Prune memory keeping 60% of memories
prune_memory --threshold 0.6

# Force pruning regardless of current capacity
prune_memory --force true
```

### Model Integration
```typescript
// Automatic pruning when needed
const result = await model.pruneMemoryByInformationGain();

// Get pruning statistics
const stats = model.getPruningStats();
```

## Benefits

1. **Quality Preservation**: Keeps high-information memories while removing redundant ones
2. **Configurable**: Extensive configuration options for different use cases
3. **Efficient**: Optimized algorithms with proper memory management
4. **Validated**: Comprehensive testing and state validation
5. **Integrated**: Seamless integration with existing memory architecture
6. **Monitored**: Detailed statistics and quality metrics

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the pruning system:

1. **Adaptive Thresholds**: Dynamic adjustment of scoring weights based on memory usage patterns
2. **Hierarchical Pruning**: Different pruning strategies for different memory tiers
3. **Temporal Considerations**: Age-based weighting in the scoring function
4. **Semantic Clustering**: Group similar memories before pruning decisions
5. **Performance Optimization**: GPU acceleration for large-scale pruning operations

## Conclusion

The smart pruning implementation successfully addresses the requirements of Step 6, providing:

- ✅ Information-gain based scoring (entropy × surprise - redundancy)
- ✅ Configurable retention percentage with quality-based selection
- ✅ Memory distillation into long-term storage
- ✅ Multiple trigger mechanisms (capacity-based and MCP command)
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests with slot reduction and recall quality verification
- ✅ Performance optimization and memory management
- ✅ Statistics and monitoring capabilities

The system maintains the balance between memory efficiency and information retention, ensuring that the most valuable memories are preserved while redundant information is efficiently removed.
