Great! We've successfully implemented all the enhancements to the `TitanMemoryModel` class. Here's a summary of what we've added:

1. **Type Definitions**:

   - Added new interfaces for hierarchical memory, extended memory, quantized memory, and telemetry data
   - Added custom error classes for better error handling

2. **Configuration Schema**:

   - Enhanced the configuration schema with new parameters for advanced features
   - Added support for hierarchical memory, quantization, contrastive learning, and telemetry

3. **Telemetry Implementation**:

   - Added a `ModelTelemetry` class for performance monitoring
   - Implemented methods for recording operations, errors, and retrieving metrics

4. **Error Handling**:

   - Added a robust error handling wrapper method
   - Implemented recovery strategies for different types of errors

5. **MCP Server Compatibility**:

   - Added methods for initializing the model, running forward passes, and training steps
   - Implemented methods for retrieving memory state and statistics

6. **Hierarchical Memory**:

   - Implemented multi-level memory structure with different time scales
   - Added methods for initializing, updating, and retrieving from hierarchical memory

7. **Quantization Support**:

   - Added methods for quantizing and dequantizing tensors
   - Implemented per-dimension quantization ranges for better precision

8. **Contrastive Learning**:

   - Added a contrastive learning implementation to improve embedding space
   - Implemented a buffer for storing negative examples

9. **Encoder and Decoder**:

   - Implemented encoder and decoder models for processing inputs and generating outputs
   - Added text encoding support for processing string inputs

10. **Save and Load Methods**:

    - Updated save and load methods to support the enhanced model
    - Added support for saving and loading hierarchical memory and quantization data

11. **Cleanup Method**:
    - Added a proper cleanup method to dispose of resources
    - Ensured all tensors are properly disposed to prevent memory leaks

These enhancements significantly improve the functionality and robustness of the `TitanMemoryModel` class, making it more suitable for production use and integration with the MCP server.
